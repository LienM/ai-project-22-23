# Final code review

The code that needs to be reviewed is located in the `final` folder.

## File structure

Each of the notebooks from the previous lectures were organized in number of the lectures, plus additional information
if one of the notebooks had extra information.

The final code is organized in a way to be easy for running for each of the algorithms that has been used for each of the notebooks.
Below, it will be shown the description of the final work notebooks:

- `Algorithms_Validation_TimedLastItemPrediction_Scenario.ipynb`: Notebook that contains the validation of the models used for this
  project with `TimedLastItemPrediction` scenario.
- `Algorithms_Validation_Timed_Scenario.ipynb`: Notebook that contains the validation of the models used for this project with `Timed` scenario.
- `AR.ipynb`: Notebook that contain the submission work to generate the best possible candidates for Kaggle submission, by running `AR` algorithm.
- `AR_EX.ipynb`: Notebook that contain the submission work to generate the best possible candidates for Kaggle submission, by running the extension
   of the `k` last recent items prediction version of `AR` algorithm.
- `AR_Last_Item.ipynb`: Notebook that contain the submission work to generate the best possible candidates for Kaggle submission, by running the extension
   of the last item prediction version of `AR` algorithm.
- `SR.ipynb`: Notebook that contain the submission work to generate the best possible candidates for Kaggle submission, by running `SR` algorithm.
- `SR_EX.ipynb`: Notebook that contain the submission work to generate the best possible candidates for Kaggle submission, by running the extension
   of the `k` last recent items prediction version of `SR` algorithm.
- `SR_Last_Item.ipynb`: Notebook that contain the submission work to generate the best possible candidates for Kaggle submission, by running the extension
   of the last item prediction version of `SR` algorithm.

## Notations
- `AR` = Association Rule
- `SR` = Sequential Rule
