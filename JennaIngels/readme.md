# Readme File
The files of my final submission are the Jupyter notebooks that are part of the same directory as this readme file.

The irrelevant code directory exists because I did not want to remove any files because of some sense of archivism, but were either never used or copied entirely into a different file.

With the exception of the EDA notebook, all notebooks have their objective and methodology written in a markup cell at the top.
