I used the notebooks from https://github.com/radekosmulski/personalized_fashion_recs as starting point.
lecture4_part1.ipynb is used to preprocess and store data. If subsequent notebooks can't find certain data, run this notebook again with different parameters in the first code cell.
The second notebook lecture4_part2.ipynb saves data to ../data/subs/{submissionname}. The submission name is printed at the end of the notebook, but you might have to create the subs directory manually.
