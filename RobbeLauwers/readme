My final submission is in the directory "final".

It is assumed that the Kaggle dataset csv files are in <project root>/data.
This includes the sample submission, but does not include the images.
Output will be written to <project root>/data/subs, which you might have to create manually if it does not yet exist.
I use Pycharm on Windows and had to set final as sources root for the filepaths to work.

For older code in this directory, run lectureX_part1.ipynb (preprocessing) before running lectureX_part2.ipynb
For the final code, run final/final_preprocess.ipynb before running final/final_main.ipynb

Older notebooks have a text cell at the top explaining the changes compared to the previous week,
but the code nad comments have not been cleaned up. The final notebook does have proper comments.

For the final code, graphs used in my presentation are not generated by the notebooks. This is because my graphs are 
based on my Kaggle scores, and I submitted my results to Kaggle manually. Instead, the file final/graphs.py reads my 
score from hardcoded csv files containing my scores.

Files in final directory:
    final_preprocess.ipynb does all preprocessing, unchanged since lecture 4.
    final_main.ipynb contains most of my code.
    graphs.py generates graphs used in my final presentation.
    Any csv file contains Kaggle scores used to generate graphs.
    Any python files I didn't mention yet contain helper functions imported by final_main.ipynb
