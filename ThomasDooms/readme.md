# Structure
### Data
Contains the raw data from Kaggle as well as intermediate/processed data files.
Nothing interesting to be found there.

### Samples
Contains small samples which can be used to test the code. 
The samples are tiny: 0.01%, small: 0.1%, medium: 1% and large 5%.

### Models
Contains the trained models.

### Experiments
Sometimes I just need a place to put some code to test something out. 
This contains my first experiments with:
- Sentence transformers (sbert) to embed text.
- Swin transformers to embed images.
- Simple pandas stuff with date & time
- Old solutions where I decided to start from scratch.

### Previous
These are the first notebooks from the really early 
lectures (eda/classification) which are not really used anymore.
